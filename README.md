### Hello World  
I'm a software engineer focused on the front end.

I've always been fascinated by the power of the web to connect and empower people. I develop user-friendly and powerful applications that provide meaningful experiences for all users.

Hopefully, we cross paths in the real world someday and we can make it a better place together.
