### Hello there  
I'm a full-stack developer from Nigeria.

My main focus is building well-architected applications that can scale and stand the test of time.

I've spent years building applications and tools that have changed—and continue to change—the way people perform their day-to-day activities.

Hopefully, we cross paths in the real world someday, and together, we can make it a better place.
